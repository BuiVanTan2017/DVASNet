Antonyms-Synonyms Discrimination Based On Exhaustive Exploiting Vietnamese Features

VIETNAMESE DATASET CONSTRUCTION
we introduce a novel Vietnamese Dataset for the antonyms-synonyms distinction task (ViAS-1000 dataset). 
Antonymous/synonymous pairs are manually selected from Vietnamese WordNet (Phuong-Thai Nguyen, 2015) 
and VCL (Huyên et al., 2006). Firstly, We extracted all antonymous and synonymous pairs according 
to the three part-of-speech categories: noun, verb and adjective. Thereafter, 400 antonymous pairs
and 600 synonym pairs are carefully selected with respect to a number of constraints:
•Two words of a pair necessarily have jointly a POS.
• The number of pairs should correspond to the natural ratio according to the part-of-speech. In
Vietnamese, the popularity degree of antonymy and synonymy decreases in the order of adjective, verb, noun.
Besides, synonyms are also much more popular than antonyms.
• Antonymous/synonymous pairs cover sufficiently the circumstances of the relation of Vietnamese such as 
single/compound words, subordinating/coordinating words reduplicative-words,
reverse-words.
• Datasets should contain words in different domains (e.g. sport, emotion, vehicle,...).
